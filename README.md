# Cipher_C
Cipher encryption, decryption and brute force utility written in C.

Current Functionality:
- Encryption and decryption function of plain text strings using the Vigen√®re cipher algorithm.
- Encryption and decryption function of plain text strings using the Caesar cipher algorithm. 
- Can specify an integer amount to shift by for encryption and decryption.
- Brute force decryption function to try all 25 possible shift amounts against a string and output each for the user to determine which string is human   
  readable, thus "cracking" the cipher.
  
To add:
+ Columnar transposition cipher encryption and decryption function.
+ N-Gram frequency analysis for scoring the 25 brute force decryption attempts based on their resemblence to English.
